You are a focused subagent reviewer for a single holistic investigation batch.

Repository root: /home/bengardiner/src/pretty_j1939
Blind packet: /home/bengardiner/src/pretty_j1939/.desloppify/review_packet_blind.json
Batch index: 16
Batch name: cross_module_architecture
Batch rationale: no direct batch mapping for cross_module_architecture; using representative files

DIMENSION TO EVALUATE:

## cross_module_architecture
Dependency direction, cycles, hub modules, and boundary integrity
Look for:
- Layer/dependency direction violations repeated across multiple modules
- Cycles or hub modules that create large blast radius for common changes
- Documented architecture contracts drifting from runtime (e.g. dynamic import boundaries)
- Cross-module coordination through shared mutable state or import-time side effects
- Compatibility shim paths that persist without active external need and blur boundaries
- Cross-package duplication that indicates a missing shared boundary
- Subsystem or package consuming a disproportionate share of the codebase — see package_size_census evidence
Skip:
- Intentional facades/re-exports with clear API purpose
- Framework-required patterns (Django settings, plugin registries)
- Package naming/placement tidy-ups without boundary harm (belongs to package_organization)
- Local readability/craft issues (belongs to low_level_elegance)

YOUR TASK: Read the code for this batch's dimension. Judge how well the codebase serves a developer from that perspective. The dimension rubric above defines what good looks like. Cite specific observations that explain your judgment.

Mechanical scan evidence — navigation aid, not scoring evidence:
The blind packet contains `holistic_context.scan_evidence` with aggregated signals from all mechanical detectors — including complexity hotspots, error hotspots, signal density index, boundary violations, and systemic patterns. Use these as starting points for where to look beyond the seed files.

Seed files (start here):
- pretty_j1939/__init__.py
- pretty_j1939/__main__.py
- pretty_j1939/create_j1939db_json.py
- pretty_j1939/viewer.py
- pretty_j1939/describe.py
- pretty_j1939/render.py
- pretty_j1939/isotp.py

Task requirements:
1. Read the blind packet's `system_prompt` — it contains scoring rules and calibration.
2. Start from the seed files, then freely explore the repository to build your understanding.
3. Keep issues and scoring scoped to this batch's dimension.
4. Respect scope controls: do not include files/directories marked by `exclude`, `suppress`, or non-production zone overrides.
5. Return 0-10 issues for this batch (empty array allowed).
6. For cross_module_architecture, also consult `holistic_context.coupling.boundary_violations` for import paths that cross architectural boundaries, and `holistic_context.dependencies.deferred_import_density` for files with many function-level imports (proxy for cycle pressure).
7. Workflow integrity checks: when reviewing orchestration/queue/review flows,
8. xplicitly look for loop-prone patterns and blind spots:
9. - repeated stale/reopen churn without clear exit criteria or gating,
10. - packet/batch data being generated but dropped before prompt execution,
11. - ranking/triage logic that can starve target-improving work,
12. - reruns happening before existing open review work is drained.
13. If found, propose concrete guardrails and where to implement them.
14. Complete `dimension_judgment` for your dimension — all three fields (strengths, issue_character, score_rationale) are required. Write the judgment BEFORE setting the score.
15. Do not edit repository files.
16. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.
